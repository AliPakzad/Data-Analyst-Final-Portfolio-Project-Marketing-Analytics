# Data-Analyst-Final-Portfolio-Project-Marketing-Analytics
Codecademy Data Analyst Final Portfolio Project - Marketing Analytics

In this project I will use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover the trends, patterns and get insights about the marketing data.I will do this through the use of summary statistics and data visualizations

I downloaded the data from Kaggle:

[marketing-data](https://www.kaggle.com/jackdaoud/marketing-data) 

This dataset has 2240 rows and 28 columns.

I plotted some charts to see if independent variables:

- income
- education
- age
- NumYearCustomer
- ChildrenHome
- Country

have association with dependent variables about amount spent on different items and number of purchases:

- mnt_wines
- mnt_fruits
- mnt_meat_products
- mnt_fish_products
- mnt_sweet_products
- mnt_gold_products
- num_deals_purchases
- num_web_purchases
- num_catalog_purchases
- num_store_purchases

My goal in this project is to find the patterns in customers buying behaviours and give useful insights about data to managers looking for data-driven decisions.So they can use it in their future marketing plans and become more successful.

I have used the knowledge of following in this Capstone project:

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn

**Project Tasks:**

Your data analytics portfolio is your secret weapon when applying for potential positions. It should not only show off your skills and experience but give your interviewers insight into how you tackle data analytics problems. Your portfolio should highlight to hiring managers how you thought about, worked through, and visualized your results. In this final portfolio project, you’ll use your understanding of data analytics and visualization to answer a question about a topic of your choosing.

For this project, you will conduct your own analysis in a Jupyter Notebook and share your results through your personal GitHub page. This project can be included as part of your portfolio when you apply for data analyst jobs. It’s good practice to showcase a variety of skills in order to make your application shine.

Project Objectives:

- Complete a project to add to a portfolio

- Use Git version control
- Use Jupyter Notebook to communicate findings
- Run an end-to-end data analytics project
- Become familiar with data analytics workflows

Prerequisites:

Python Fundamentals

Data Acquisition

Data Manipulation with Pandas

Data Wrangling and Tidying

Summary Statistics

Hypothesis Testing

Data Visualization

Communicating Data Analysis Findings

================================================================================

## 1.Setting up your Git Repository

Create a new Git repository for this project.

Hint:

If you need more guidance, review the GitHub Desktop article and additional help on this Git cheat sheet.

Main components that you will want to include:

Jupyter Notebook

CSV data file(s)


## 2.Project Scoping

Properly scoping your project will greatly benefit you; scoping creates structure while requiring you to think through your entire project before you begin. You should start with stating the goals for your project, then gathering the data, and considering the analytical steps required. A proper project scope can be a great road map for 
your project, but keep in mind that some down-stream tasks may become dead ends which will require adjustment to the scope.

## 3.Select Data Analyst Solvable Problem

First choose a topic of interest; then, within your topic, select a problem that you can answer using a data analytics approach. Make sure that this problem can be solved in a reasonable amount of time and with available data. If the problem is too complex, it might be worth breaking it down into smaller units.

Hint:

Main components that you will want to include:

Topic eg. E-commerce

Problem eg. A/B testing

How will EDA be used eg. using summary statistics and visualizations to select the best layout in an A/B test

## 4.Collect Data

If you didn’t already have a dataset in mind, search the internet and see if it’s freely available. If data is not available, go back to the previous step and find a new problem that will have data readily available.

We recommend using a business or marketing dataset that lends itself well to the field of data analytics.

Here are some locations for data.

data.gov

kaggle

data.world

awesomedata

Fivethirtyeight

Buzzfeed

UCI

Main components that you will want to include: Data

## 5.Load and Check Data

Once you obtain your data, check to see if the data has the right unit of observation or granularity. Make sure it has the variables that you need for your exploratory 

data analysis and that there is enough data.

Hint:

Main components that you will want to include:

- Data with proper units
- Data with proper variables

## 6.Data Wrangling and Tidying

Clean your data and make sure it is ready for exploratory data analysis.

Here are some resources to help you:

Working with missing data: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/missing_data.html

Reshaping and pivot tables: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/reshaping.html

Main components that you will want to focus on:

- Shape of your data
- Dealing with missing data
- Data types

## 7.Explore the Data

Once your data is cleaned and ready to go, explore it through the use of summary statistics and data visualizations. Make sure to document findings along the way.

Hint:

Here is the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) EDA Introduction

Main components that you will want to include:

- Descriptive statistics like mean, median, range, correlations
- Data visualizations for univariate and multivariate exploration
- Text explaining insights gained from exploration

## 8.Communicate Findings

Make your visualizations and documented findings easy to decipher for potential stakeholders and/or the general public.

Hint:

Think about who you want to communicate your results with. You may want to make them accessible to:

The general public in a blog post

A marketing department

Managers looking for data-driven decisions

Other data analysts

Depending on who your audience is, you will need to craft your findings and visualizations in such a way that they can understand.

## 9.Conclusion

Finally, we can wrap up the project. You can write a conclusion about your process and findings.

Hint:

Main components that you will want to include:

- What did you learn through the process?
- Are the results what you expected?
- What are the key findings/takeaways?

## 10.Next Steps

Lastly, being a data analyst is about making continual progress. What are future-looking takeaways and limitations? If you were to do this project again, how can you extend this analysis?

Hint:

Main components that you will want to include:

- Are there things that should be done differently?
- How can this be used in the future?
- Are there further variables and relationships to analyze?
- Is there more data to look at?
